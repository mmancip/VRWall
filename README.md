# VRWall

## What is VRWEBWALL ?
Maison de la simulation is equipped with a stereoscopic image wall and a graphics calculator called Mandelbrot. This wall, with a resolution of 33 million pixels, allows the visualization of large data. It is used by researchers from various scientific fields such as astrophysics, climatology, chemistry and biology.
Being installed at the Maison de la Simulation, the image wall is accessible not only to members of the MDLS, but also to other laboratories who wish it. However, the problem arises of making it easier for researchers to use this type of device. The MDLS therefore decided to offer a portable alternative using mixed reality headsets (Microsoft Hololens2), called VR WALL.

## How to build/deploy
